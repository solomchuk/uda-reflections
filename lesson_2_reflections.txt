What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates metadata needed to track changes in the repository.
Can't track changes without the metadata.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
WD - everything is still a work in progress and can change.
SA - when something is ready for a commit and doesn't have to change anymore, it goes here.
Helps with tracking the progress of a planned commit.

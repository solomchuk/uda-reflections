When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working on the same materials across multiple devices
When collaborating with other people
When sharing the results with, say, a client
When working on a device with limited local storage capacity

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some changes might not be ready to be committed to remote
Again - choosing the timing is important, don't want to update mid-edit
Some changes might need to stay secret for a time
Pulling from remote - your local version might depend on things that got changed/removed on remote

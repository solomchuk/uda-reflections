When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working on the same materials across multiple devices
When collaborating with other people
When sharing the results with, say, a client
When working on a device with limited local storage capacity

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - clone of repo on Github. Use when you want to take someone's work and move in another direction
without affecting the source project. Also keeps track of where it was cloned from.
Clone - any clone of a repo (local to local, remote to local, remote to remote). Does not keep track of
whenre it was cloned from. Use for your own work or if you don't care about the origin.
Branch is sort of like a clone within a repo. Allows you to experiment, or others to work on the project
in parallel. Can be merged back into master branch.

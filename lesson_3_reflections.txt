When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working on the same materials across multiple devices
When collaborating with other people
When sharing the results with, say, a client
When working on a device with limited local storage capacity

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some changes might not be ready to be committed to remote
Again - choosing the timing is important, don't want to update mid-edit
Some changes might need to stay secret for a time
Pulling from remote - your local version might depend on things that got changed/removed on remote

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - clone of repo on Github. Use when you want to take someone's work and move in another direction
without affecting the source project. Also keeps track of where it was cloned from.
Clone - any clone of a repo (local to local, remote to local, remote to remote). Does not keep track of
whenre it was cloned from. Use for your own work or if you don't care about the origin.
Branch is sort of like a clone within a repo. Allows you to experiment, or others to work on the project
in parallel. Can be merged back into master branch.
